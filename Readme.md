# Middle Greek Converter
 
This is a script that converts ancient greek to "middle" greek. 
Middle is a version between modern (koine) greek and ancient greek language that I propose myself to be adopted by everyone that uses modern greek.
	
## Proposition

* Use the Circumflex accent (perispomene)
* Use the Rough breathing (dasia)
* Use the iota subscript
* Don't use the Smooth breathing (psili)
* Don't use the grave accent (varia)
  
## Info
Some basic info on [greek diacritics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_diacritics). 

## Rationalization (in short)

The removal of the necessary info that some of the diacritics provide is absurd.

* The Circumflex accent (Perispomene) although it is supposed not to have any phonetic consequence in modern greek, has a deeply rooted grammatical consequence and therefore it is necessary to conserve.
 
* The Rough breathing (Dasia) is the explanation of simple, every day, "alien" grammatical phenomena and therefore should be conserved.  
e.g. κάθοδος <- κατά+ὁδός, but κατοικία <- κατά+οῖκος

* The Iota Subscript although more rare because dative case has been removed in modern greek, is necessary because it provides the info of a whole letter and also has grammatical consequence in modern greek. Since there are phrases and cases for dative forms that have survived in the pass of time, they should be carried over "as is".
 
* The Smooth breathing (psili) is needless in the same way varia is. It is used when the rough breathing isn't used and therefore you can easily extract its info by its absence.
 
* The Grave accent (varia) is needless and is correctly removed in modern greek because it is used when the acute accent (oxia) isn't used.

## Comments
Some important capital characters (like "GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ETA WITH PERISPOMENI") and other non-important (that should be included since their small variant are) are missing from Unicode. 
These are: 

* GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA WITH PERISPOMENI
* GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ETA WITH PERISPOMENI
* GREEK CAPITAL LETTER IOTA WITH PERISPOMENI
* GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI
* GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA WITH OXIA WITH PROSGEGRAMMENI
* GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA WITH PERISPOMENI WITH PROSGEGRAMMENI
* GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ETA WITH OXIA WITH PROSGEGRAMMENI
* GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ETA WITH PERISPOMENI WITH PROSGEGRAMMENI
* GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA WITH OXIA WITH PROSGEGRAMMENI
* GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA WITH PERISPOMENI WITH PROSGEGRAMMENI

## Script's Future

* The ability to convert from modern greek to middle.
* Spell check for the middle greek, which is potentially a consequence of the modern to middle conversion.
